# aws-keyhub
CLI login helper for the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) when using SAML based federated login with [Topicus KeyHub](https://www.topicus-keyhub.com).

## Usage

### Installation

#### Release version
Download the latest release from https://github.com/topicuskeyhub/aws-keyhub/releases

##### Linux / macOS
1. Make the binary executable `chmod +x ./aws-keyhub`
2. Move the binary to a file location on your system PATH. `sudo mv ./aws-keyhub /usr/local/bin/aws-keyhub`
3. macOS only: this binary is not notarized. To open a non-notarized application you can [follow this guide from Apple.](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac) 

##### Windows
1. Install the binary on your system's PATH
   1. In Search, search for and then select: System (Control Panel)
   2. Click the Advanced system settings link. 
   3. Click Environment Variables. In the section System Variables find the PATH environment variable and select it. Click Edit. If the PATH environment variable does not exist, click New. 
   5. In the Edit System Variable (or New System Variable) window, click “New” and type in the new path you want to add. This should be the folder where aws-keyhub is located. Close all remaining windows by clicking OK. 
   6. Reopen Command prompt window, and start `aws-keyhub`

### Configuration
To set up the aws-keyhub tool we need the KeyHub url, aws-keyhub ClientId and AWS SAML ClientId. Configuring these properties can be done by running with the `configure` command: `aws-keyhub configure`

### Authenticate
When the application is configured you can run the tool by executing `aws-keyhub login`.
It will open a webpage of KeyHub where you can authorize aws-keyhub. It then retrieves the roles. These roles are the AWS roles that you have access to in one or more AWS accounts.
If you provide the `--role-arn` parameter along with a valid role ARN for your account, that role will be automatically selected and you won't be prompted for a choice. For example `aws-keyhub login --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyCustomRole`

### Session duration
Due to [restrictions by Amazon Web Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithSAML.html) the maximum duration of the session is 12 hours. If authentication fails when using the AWS CLI please re-run the `aws-keyhub login` command to get a new session. The default session duration is 12 hours (43200 sec). If you need a shorter duration please reconfigure with `aws-keyhub configure`.

## Topicus KeyHub configuration
For optimal usage of this tool your KeyHub instance needs to be configured to send additional SAML payload. The payload helps a user to select the right role if they have access to multiple AWS accounts by displaying a description. Add the custom attribute ```https://github.com/topicuskeyhub/aws-keyhub/groups``` with the following code to build the descriptive array.

```javascript
// Function returns a list of descriptive objects based on a UUID match
var mapping = new Map();
mapping.set('aaabbbcc-2222-aaaa-3333-fffff0000000', {
    'account' : 'example-account-name',
    'role' : 'inzicht',
    'arn' : 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyCustomRole,arn:aws:iam::123456789012:saml-provider/keyhub'
});

return groups.filter(function (group) {
    return mapping.has(group.uuid);
  }).map(function (group) {
    return "{\"description\": \"" + mapping.get(group.uuid).account + " - " + mapping.get(group.uuid).role + "\", \"arn\": \"" + mapping.get(group.uuid).arn + "\"}";
  });
```

## FAQ
#### How is my KeyHub password stored?
Your password is no longer stored in version 2 of this tool. It does store a temporary OIDC access token. 

#### Where is the configuration stored?
The configuration is stored in ```~/.aws-keyhub/config-v2.json```

#### Help! The login flow is broken, something seems to be corrupt.
Please verify that you can successfully login to the AWS console in your browser before using this tool.

## Migrating from v1 to v2
There is no migration path, you have to install and configure aws-keyhub again. Any previous configuration is not persisted. 

### Removing the old aws-keyhub
1. Uninstall aws-keyhub using npm `npm uninstall -g aws-keyhub`
2. Remove the old v1 configuration files by deleting the following files and directories:
   ```
   ~/.aws-keyhub/config.json
   ~/.aws-keyhub/puppeteer_profile
   ```

### Command mapping
We have changed a number of commands in v2. Here is a mapping of the v1 commands and their counterparts in v2.

| v1                           | v2                          |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| aws-keyhub -V                | aws-keyhub version          |
| aws-keyhub --configure       | aws-keyhub configure        |
| aws-keyhub                   | aws-keyhub login            |
| aws-keyhub --role-arn        | aws-keyhub login --role-arn |
| aws-keyhub --help            | aws-keyhub help             |
|                              |                             |
